## About
This Website is running on my raspberry pi zero 2w.

Used:

• [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) - For making the website.

• [Hugo Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/) -The cool theme.

• [Cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/) - For making the website public.

• [This page](https://nathancraddock.com/blog/hugo-server-on-local-and-public-networks/) - For help with getting hugo and cloudflared working well.

• [Me](https://github.com/j0shua-daniel) - Putting everything together!
